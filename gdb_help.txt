Using https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard for easier debugging,
but gdb is not respecting instructions such as 'n'(it steps into 
even though it shouldn't)

s - step
x/3xw 0x800 - show memory contents at 0x800, 3 words(w) in hex(x)
i r - info registers
list - list source code
save breakpoints 'f.brk' - save breakpoints to file
source f.brk - load breakpoints
