# ASMTUTOR - Tutoring myself through nasm x64/x86

## What is this?
![What is pepe](https://emoji.gg/assets/emoji/7739-monkathink.png)

A personal public repository where I keep track of my progress
in learning assembly for fun and for giggles.

## What are you following?

Oh, but [asmtutor](https://asmtutor.com/), of course. Also
this [NASM Tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/)
and the [official docs](https://www.nasm.us/doc).

## Cool, but ..why?
![cause we all gonna make it](https://emoji.gg/assets/emoji/6652-pepeblink.png)

Because you cannot build your own OS from scratch if you 
cannot assemble right. Even the Avengers can do it.

And also 'cause we all tryin' to make it and we all gonna make it!
